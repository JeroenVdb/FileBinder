FileBinder
==========
Save a set of openend files to a binder and reopen them again anytime you need them.

#### Commands

- Choose a binder
- Remove a binder
- Add this set of files to a binder
- Update a binder 

#### Settings

- remember_groups (default: true): Save and restore original window grid layout when you open a binder
- show_number_of_files (default: true): Show the number of files in each binder
- show_path_teaser (default: true): Show the first three file paths of each binder

I've added an example User/FileBinder.sublime-settings file with custom settings [here](https://raw.github.com/JeroenVdb/FileBinder/master/FileBinder-example.sublime-settings).
